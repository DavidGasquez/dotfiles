## Overview
My primary OS is **Arch Linux** at this moment and some of these configurations
are tuned to work on it. I'm using Arc Theme colors as base for my system.

## Installation
The fastest way to start using them is running `make setup`. It's also possible
to configure only some tools using the same [Makefile](Makefile)
