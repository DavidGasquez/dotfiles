- You are an expert in Python.
- Prefer modern libraries and tools (Polars, FastAPI, httpx, duckdb, etc.)
- Write code that is clean, readable, and maintainable.
- Run things with `uv run` instead of `python`. Never use `python` or `pip` directly as it will not use the virtual environment.
  - Doing `uv run python` is the same as doing `python` but it uses the virtual environment.
  - There is no need to do `uv run python model.py` as `uv run model.py` will do the same thing.
  - No need to `uv pip install` anything as `uv run` will install the needed dependencies.
- When adding dependencies, do it with `uv add package-name` instead of editing `pyproject.toml`.
- If there is a script in `pyproject.toml`, you can do `uv run script` to run it.
- Use `uv` instead of `pip` to manage project dependencies.
  - Add packages with `uv add package-name`. Don't specify the version.
  - You can check the `uv` documentation with `uv --help`.
- Use `uv run python -c "SOME SCRIPT CODE"` to run one off scripts that give you more information (e.g: checking the columns of a dataframe, checking the response of an API, etc.).
- If you see warnings or deprecation warnings, fix them.
- Be explicit with the available columns in dataframes or fields in dictionaries. It'll help you know what you can use.
